# Java implementation of optimizing algorithms

This project is part of a study assignment and implements some optimization algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
Java was used as a backend for efficient implementation of the algorithms and in addition a HTML frontend for simple usage was created.
